FILE ATTRIBUTES (C)1991 Turgut Kalfaoglu

This program enables you to  change the "attributes" of your files.
Attributes determine if your file is to be hidden, a system file, a read-only
file, etc. 

Warning: This program enables you to turn a subdirectory into a file and back
too, and this would result in data corruption, and may result in the loss of
that directory! Likewise, the (V)olume option can confuse CHKDSK and other
diagnostic programs, if you define more than one file as the volume label 
of a drive.

This is not free software
